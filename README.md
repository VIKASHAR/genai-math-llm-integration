## Integration of a Mathematical Calulations with a Chat Completion System using LLM Function-Calling

### AIM:
To design and implement a Python function for calculating the volume of a cylinder, integrate it with a chat completion system utilizing the function-calling feature of a large language model (LLM).

### PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Design and implement a system where:

1. Users interact with a chat interface to calculate the volume of a cylinder.
2. User inputs such as the radius and height of the cylinder are extracted via the LLM.
3. The extracted inputs are passed to a Python function that calculates the volume.
4. The LLM integrates this function and provides the result to the user.

### DESIGN STEPS:

#### STEP 1: Define the Python Function
Create a function calculate_cylinder_volume to compute the volume of a cylinder using the formula:
Volume = ùúã √ó ùëü2 √ó ‚Ñé
where, r is the radius and ‚Ñé is the height.

#### STEP 2: LLM Integration
Integrate the function with the LLM using a function-calling interface, allowing the LLM to invoke the Python function based on user queries.

#### STEP 3: User Query Parsing
Use the LLM's ability to interpret natural language queries to extract values for radius and height.

#### STEP 4: Function Invocation
Pass the extracted values to the Python function, compute the result, and return it to the LLM.

#### STEP 5: Result Formatting
Present the result in a user-friendly format and provide additional guidance if necessary.
